# Overview

Remote access to the UTRS Aviation Safety Technology Division's (organization) Aviation Safety Information System (ASIS) AWS Management Consoles and virtual infrastructure is essential to maintain productivity, however, incoming traffic is by nature from home or public access points via the public internet.  While security of home and public remote networks access points is beyond the control of UTRS Aviation Safety Technology Division (organization), we must mitigate these external risks the best of our ability.
