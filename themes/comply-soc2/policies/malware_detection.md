# Overview

Malware threats must be managed to minimize the amount of downtime realized by organization’s systems and prevent risk to critical systems and member data.

> Note: The terms ***virus*** and ***malware***, as well as ***anti-virus*** and ***anti-malware***, are used interchangeably. 

# Purpose

This policy is established to help prevent infection of organization computers, networks, and technology systems from malware and other malicious code. This policy is intended to help prevent damage to user applications, data, files, and hardware.

# Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants (hereinafter "*users*") of UTRS Aviation Safety Technology Division (organization) as well as computers, mobile, and other devices connecting to the organization's virtual infrastructure. 

# References

a. Reference A: Employee and Consultant Handbooks

# Policy

a. All computer devices connected to the organization network and networked resources shall have anti-virus software installed and configured so that the virus definition files are current and are routinely and automatically updated. The anti-virus software must be actively running on these devices.

a. The virus protection software must not be disabled or bypassed.

a. The settings for the virus protection software must not be altered in a manner that will reduce the effectiveness of the software.

a. The automatic update frequency of the virus protection software must not be altered to reduce the frequency of updates.
Each file server, attached to the organization network, must utilize organization IT approved virus protection software and setup to detect and clean viruses that may infect organization resources.

a. All files on computer devices will be scanned periodically for malware.

a. Every virus that is not automatically cleaned by the virus protection software constitutes a security incident and must be reported to the Cybersecurity Manager (<cybsecurity@ustrs.com>).

## Application Installation and Management

a. Systems Network Administrators are responsible for installing and updating virtual infrastruture requiring virus protection.

a. Employees receiving organization-owned equipment either have protection applications pre-installed, or will be reimbursed for the acquition cost of approved applications.

a. Consultants providing personally-owned equipment are responsible for acquiring and maintaining recommeded or equivilent protection applications.

a. Organization recommended applications:

    i. [Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac](https://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/antivirus-for-mac.html)

    i. [Bitdefender Antivirus Plus for Windows](https://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/antivirus.html)

    i. [Malwarebytes Premium for Mac](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mac)

    i. [Malwarebytes Premium for Windows](https://www.malwarebytes.com/premium)

    i. Windows users may use Windows Defender in lieu of Bitdefender and Malwarebytes

    i. If eSET is pre-installed it may be used in lieu of Bitdefender and Malwarebytes

a. All users are responsible for ensuring:

    i. Protection applications are installed on all applicable systems/devices

    i. Software licenses and applications are current

    i. Virus signatures are updated

    i. Real-time scanning is running

    i. **Users should:**

        + Avoid viruses by **NEVER** opening any files or macros attached to an e-mail from an unknown, suspicious, or untrustworthy source. Delete these attachments immediately then remove them from the Trash or Recycle Bin

        + Delete spam, chain, or other junk mail without opening or forwarding the item

        + Never download files from unknown or suspicious sources

        + Always scan removable media from an unknown or non-organization source (such as a CD or USB from a vendor) for viruses before using it

        + Back up critical data on a regular basis and store the data in a safe place

## Common Malware Threats

a. Malware is short for ***Mal***icious soft***ware***", a program or file that is unknowingly purchased, downloaded, or installed, and designed to specifically damage or disrupt a system. Malware is often deployed through phishing emails. In short, threat actors send emails to employees containing links to websites or embed attachments within the email itself. If an action is taken, such as clicking the link or downloading the attachment, the malicious code is executed and you can consider yourself breached.

a. The most common types of malware include:

    + **Viruses**: A program that attaches itself to an executable file or vulnerable application and delivers a payload that ranges from annoying to extremely destructive. A file virus executes when an infected file is accessed. A macro virus infects the executable code embedded in Microsoft Office programs that allows users to generate macros

    + **Keyloggers**: A computer program that captures the keystrokes of a computer user and stores them. Modern keyloggers can store additional information, such as images of the user’s screen. Most malicious keyloggers send this data to a third party remotely (such as via email)

    + **Worms**: A program that makes copies of itself elsewhere in a computing system. These copies may be created on the same computer or may be sent over networks to other computers. Some worms are security threats using networks to spread themselves against the wishes of the system owners and disrupting networks by overloading them. A worm is similar to a virus in that it makes copies of itself, but different in that it need not attach to particular files or sectors at all

    + **Trojans**: AKA "*Trojan Horse*", are destructive programs, usually viruses or worms, which are hidden in an attractive or innocent looking piece of software, such as a game or graphics program. Victims may receive a Trojan horse program by e-mail or removable media, often from another unknowing victim, or may be urged to download a file from a web site or download site

    + **Ransomware**: A type of malware that prevents or limits users from accessing their system, either by locking the system's screen or by locking the users' files, unless a ransom is paid

    + **Logic Bombs**: A piece of code intentionally inserted into a software system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met. Software that is inherently malicious often contain logic bombs that execute a certain payload at a pre-defined time or when some other condition is met

    + **Bots/Botnets**: An *Internet bot*, *web robot*, *robot* or simply *bot*, is a software application that runs automated tasks (scripts) over the Internet, usually with the intent to imitate human activity on the Internet, such as messaging, on a large scale. A *botnet* is a group of Internet-connected devices, each of which runs one or more bots. Botnets can be used to perform Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, steal data, send spam, and allow the attacker to access the device and its connection

    + **Adware**: Programs that are downloaded and installed without user’s consent or bound with other software to conduct commercial advertisement propaganda through pop-ups or other ways, which often lead to system slowness or exception after installing -- may also be spyware

    + **Spyware**: Programs that install and gather information from a computer without permission and reports the information to the creator of the software or to one or more third parties

    + **Rootkits**: A collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable access to a computer or an area of its software that is not otherwise allowed (for example, to an unauthorized user) and often masks its existence or the existence of other software
