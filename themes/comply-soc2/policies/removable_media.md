# Purpose

This policy:

 a. Defines the objectives, requirements and implementing instructions for storing data on removable media, in cloud environments, and on personally-owned devices, regardless of data classification level.

a. Aapplies to all information and data within the UTRS Aviation Safety Technology Division (organization) information security program, as well as all removable media, cloud systems and personally-owned devices.

# Scope

This policy applies to all users of information systems within the organization. This typically includes employees and contractors, as well as any external parties that come into contact with systems and information controlled by the organization (hereinafter referred to as “users”). This policy must be made readily available to all users.

# Background

a. Organization users may use authorized removable media with their devices for work-related functions. Sensitive information generally should not be stored on removable media. If this is required for organization work, it **must** be **encrypted**. Employees, contractors, and temporary staff will follow all UTRS Aviation Safety Division data removal policies, including the Media Sensitization Guide, to permanently erase UTRS Aviation Safety Division-specific data from such devices once their use is no longer required. All users agree to immediately report to his/her manager and the UTRS Aviation Safety Division Cybersecurity Manager any incident or suspected incidents of unauthorized data access, data loss, and/or disclosure of UTRS Aviation Safety Division resources, databases, networks, etc.

a. Organization users with equipment provided by and/or connected to the AFNET may only use removable media specifically provided by the USAF for use on government computers and networks. AFNET rules and procedures apply to data protection including encryption of internal and external storage devices and removable media.

a. This document consists of three sections pertaining to removable media, personal cloud storage, and personally-owned devices. Each section contains requirements and implementing instructions for the registration, management, maintenance, and disposition of each type of storage.

a. Within this policy, the term sensitive information refers to information that is classified as RESTRICTED or CONFIDENTIAL in accordance with Reference 4A.
