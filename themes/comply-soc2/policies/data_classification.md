# Scope

This policy:

a. Applies to:

    i. The entire scope of the organization's information security program. It includes
    all types of information, regardless of its form, such as paper or electronic documents,
    applications and databases, and knowledge or information that is not written.

    i. All employees, contractors, consultants, vendors, and systems (hereinafter *users*) that have access to information received/transmitted, stored, or processed by the organization.

    i. Does **not** apply to classification and marking of National Security System Information.

# Background

This policy defines the high level objectives and implementation instructions for the
organization’s data classification scheme. This includes data classification levels, as well as
procedures for the classification, labeling and handling of data within the organization.

# References

a. Reference A: Risk Assessment Policy

a. Reference B: Security Incident Management Policy

# Policy

a. If classified information is received from outside the organization, the person who receives the
information must classify it in accordance with the rules prescribed in this policy. The person
thereby will become the owner of the information.

a. If classified information is received from outside the organization and handled as part of
business operations activities (e.g., customer data on provided cloud services), the information
classification, as well as the owner of such information, must be made in accordance with the
specifications of the respective customer service agreement and other legal requirements.

a. When classifying information, the level of confidentiality is determined by:

    i. The value of the information, based on impacts identified during the risk assessment process.
    More information on risk assessments is defined in the Risk Assessment Policy (Reference 5a).

    i. Sensitivity and criticality of the information, based on the highest risk calculated for each information item during the risk assessment.

    i. Legal, regulatory and contractual obligations.

**Table 3: Information Confidentiality Levels**

&nbsp;

d. Information must be classified based on confidentiality levels as defined in Table 3.

e. Information and information system owners should try to use the lowest confidentiality level that ensures an adequate level of protection, thereby avoiding unnecessary production costs.

f. Information and information system owners must review the confidentiality level of their
information assets every five years and assess whether the confidentiality level should be changed.
Wherever possible, confidentiality levels should be lowered.

g. For cloud-based software services provided to customers, system owners under the company’s
control must also review the confidentiality level of their information systems after service
agreement changes or after a customer’s formal notification. Where allowed by service agreements,
confidentiality levels should be lowered.

a. Information must be labeled according to the following:

    i. Paper documents: the confidentiality level is indicated on the top and bottom of each
    document page; it is also indicated on the front of the cover or envelope carrying such a
    document as well as on the filing folder in which the document is stored. If a document is not
    labeled, its default classification is "Internal Use".

    i. Electronic documents: the confidentiality level is indicated on the top and bottom of each
    document page. If a document is not labeled, its default classification is "Internal Use".

    i. Information systems: the confidentiality level of data in the Aviation Safety Information System applications and databases is "Restricted".
    
    i. Electronic mail: the confidentiality level is indicated in the first line of the email body.
    If it is not labeled, its default classification is “Internal Use”.
    
    i. Electronic storage media (disks, memory cards, etc.): the confidentiality level must be
    indicated on the top surface of the media. If it is not labeled, its default classification
    is “Internal Use”.
    
    i. Information transmitted orally: the confidentiality level is presumed to be Internal Use unless otherwise stated.

a. All persons accessing classified information must review and sign the Aviation Safety Non-Disclosure Agreement. 

a. Incidents related to the improper handling of classified information must be reported in
accordance with the Security Incident Management Policy (Reference 5B).
