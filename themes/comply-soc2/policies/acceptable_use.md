Users may be subject to disciplinary action which may include repayment of the replacement value of the equipment. The organization has the discretion to not issue or re-issue IT devices and equipment to users who repeatedly lose or damage IT equipment.

## Use of Social Media

The use of public social media sites to promote organizational activities requires written pre-approval from the organization management.  Approval is at the discretion of management and may be granted upon demonstration of a business need, and a review and approval of service agreement terms by organization’s Counsel’s Office. Final approval by management should define the scope of the approved activity, including, but not limited to, identifying approved users.
Unless specifically authorized, the use of organizational email addresses on public social media sites is prohibited. In instances where users access social media sites on their own time utilizing personal resources, they must remain sensitive to expectations that they will conduct themselves in a responsible, professional, and secure manner with regard to references to the organization and staff. These expectations are outlined below. 

### Use of Social Media within the Scope of Official Duties

a. The organziation's Vice President, or designee, must review and approve the content of any posting of public information, such as blog comments, tweets, video files, or streams, to social media sites on behalf of the organization. However, management approval is not required for postings to public forums for technical support, if participation in such forums is within the scope of the user’s official duties, has been previously approved by his or her supervisor, and does not include the posting of any sensitive information, including specifics of the IT infrastructure. 

a. Accounts used to manage the organization’s social media presence are privileged accounts and must be treated as such. These accounts are for official use only and must not be used for personal use. Passwords of privileged accounts must follow information security standards, be unique on each site, and must not be the same as passwords used to access other IT resources. 

### Guidelines for Personal Use of Social Media

Organization personnel should be sensitive to the fact that information posted on social media sites clearly reflects on the individual and may also reflect on the individual’s professional life. Consequently, they should use discretion when posting information on these sites and be conscious of the potential perceptions of and responses to the information. It is important to remember that once information is posted on a social media site, it can be captured and used in ways not originally intended. It is nearly impossible to retract, as it often lives on in copies, archives, backups, and memory cache.

a. Users should respect the privacy of fellow team members and not post any personally identifying information (PII) of anyone without permission (including, but not limited to, names, addresses, photos, videos, email addresses, and phone numbers). Users may be held liable for comments posted on social media sites. 

a. If a personal email, posting, or other electronic message could be construed to be an official communication, a disclaimer is ***strongly recommended***. For example: “The views and opinions expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of the organization.” 

a. Users should not use their personal social media accounts for official business, unless specifically authorized by the organization. Users are strongly discouraged from using the same passwords in their personal use of social media sites as those used on organizational devices and IT resources, to prevent unauthorized access to resources if the password is compromised.
