# Purpose

This policy addresses cybersecurity education and training requirements for employees and contractors of the UTRS Aviation Safety Technology Division (organization). 

# Scope

This policy applies to all full-time employees, part-time employees, and contractors (hereinafter "*personnel*" or "*workforce*") of the organization. Adherence to assigned policies is binding under the employment agreement and/or Independent Contractor Agreement. 

# Background

Security and compliance is everyone's responsibility.  The organization is committed to ensuring all workforce members actively address security and compliance in their roles. Statistically, cybersecurity breaches typically start with compromise of end-user computing devices, social engineering, human error or insider threat. Therefore, users are the first line of defense and yet usually the weakest link. As such, training is imperative to assuring an understanding of current best practices, the different types and sensitivities of data, and the sanctions associated with non-compliance.
