# Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define security procedures within the organizationâ€™s data centers and secure equipment areas.

# Scope

a. This policy applies to:

    i. Any cloud hosted providers and facilities within the organization that are labeled as either a data center or a secure equipment area. Such facilities are explicitly called out within this document.

    i. All management, employees and suppliers that conduct business operations within cloud host or data centers and secure equipment areas.

# Background

This policy provides guidelines governing data centers and secure equipment areas from both a physical and logical security perspective. The document lists all data centers and secure equipment areas in use by the organization, prescribes how access is controlled and enforced, and establishes procedures for any visitor or third party access. This policy also provides examples of prohibited activities and requirements for periodic safety and security checks.

# Policy

a. The following locations are classified by the organization as secure areas and are governed by this policy:

    i. Amazon Web Services Regions 

    i. Physical data centers located within each region

## Amazon Web Services Data Centers

a. AWS physical data centers are unmarked. Access to the secure area is controlled by at least a locked door and generally two locked doors forming a sally port. Admittance requires an AWS photo ID badge allowing physical access. Uniformed security guards verify authorization and log entry and exit time of each person.

a. Persons who are not employed or contracted by AWS are considered to be visitors. Visitors accessing secure areas shall:

    i. Visitors are generally not permitted access to physical data centers.

    i. A visitor will require prior authorization and escort by a designated employee authorized to escort visitors.

a. AWS prohibits certain activities while within the secured areas of the data center, including:

    i. Photography, or video or audio recordings of any kind.

    i. Unauthorized usage of or tampering with any installed equipment.

    i. Connection of any device to the network.

    i. Storage of flammable materials or equipment.

    i. Smoking, eating, or drinking.

a. To further secure physical data centers, AWS has a strict separation of duties rule:

    i. Persons with physical access to a data center are prohibited from having logical access to the infrastructure (servers, storage drives, etc.)

    i. Persons with logical access to AWS systems are prohibited from having physical access to the data centers

a. Secure areas are checked for compliance with security and safety requirements on at least a quarterly basis.

# Compliance

a. AWS maintains several security-related certifications and attestations including:

    - SOC 1 and 2

    - FedRAMP

    - CJIS

    - ISO 27001
